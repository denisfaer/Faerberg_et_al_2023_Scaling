Folders labeled **appendix2** and **figure5** provide codes to recapitulate analysis in the relevant figures.

The Python script ``bootsrap.py`` is as an easy way to run the proposed analysis and get an empirical p-value.



### How to run the BOOTSRAP.PY script:

1. Format your data into a basic CSV file where rows represent individuals and columns represent timepoints. This file shouldn't contains labels or anything else besides raw data. See the ``elegans_embryos.csv`` file for reference.
2. Download the ``bootsrap.py`` code and place it in the same folder as your formatted CSV file.
